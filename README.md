bazel_typescript_closure_sample

This repository holds a sample application using bazel, typescript, and closure compiler including:

    A simple node library (using node package dependencies)
    A Jasmine test for the library
    An Express app that exposes the library as an API
    A minified client distribution of the library

The intention is to serve as a personal reference for standing up similar projects in the future. The starting point is a Bazel installation. All dependencies are downloaded and managed by Bazel, including Node and Yarn.

See the [guide](GUIDE.md) for a step-by-step breakdown of the sample project.
